Last year, together with two collaborators (Lucien Baumgartner; Krzysztof S&#281;kowski), I worked on a project that aimed to track the semantic disruptiveness of influential philosophy publications. We presented the material a couple of times, but ultimately decided that the project was not worth pursuing. Still, I thought the research was interesting enough methodologically to merit some sort of write up. That&#8217;s what this post is (though I&#8217;m mostly going to focus on the parts that I contributed).

The motivation for the project had to do with <em>conceptual engineering </em>(CE). I have to confess that even though I&#8217;ve now been to more than one workshop on CE, I&#8217;m still not entirely sure what CE is all about, so here&#8217;s a quote from <a   id="x1-2"></a>Chalmers (2020): &#8220;Conceptual engineering is the design, implementation, and evaluation of concepts. Conceptual engineering includes or should include de novo conceptual engineering (designing a new concept) as well as conceptual re-engineering (fixing an old concept)&#8221; (1). Some philosophers think CE is a new thing; others disagree. One open question question is whether there are examples of articles or books in the philosophical literature that have caused significant conceptual change in the philosophical community (or parts of it) in the past. In addition to being open, the question is also an empirical one, and so we thought we&#8217;d attempt to address it using the tools of corpus linguistics. We chose three candidate concepts that plausibly underwent change in the recent history of philosophy: <em>belief </em>; <em>consciousness</em>; and <em>reference</em>. We chose these three examples because each features prominently in a very influential book or article published during the last 50 years that many see as having done much to change the concept in question (at least to some extent). For belief: Clark, A., &amp; Chalmers, D. (1998). &#8220;The Extended Mind.&#8221; <em>Analysis</em>, 58(1), 7&#8211;19; for consciousness: Chalmers, D. (1996). <em>The Conscious Mind: In Search of a Fundamental Theory</em>. Oxford University Press; for reference: Kripke, S. (1980). <em>Naming and Necessity</em>. Harvard University Press.

While major problems still remain with testing for conceptual change directly (e.g., <a   id="x1-3"></a>Recchia et al., 2017; <a   id="x1-4"></a>Hengchen et al., 2021), conceptual change tends to (though need not) go hand in hand with semantic change. This is useful because there are a number of well-established methods to detect and measure semantic change (for a survey, see, <a   id="x1-5"></a>Tahmasebi et al., 2019). We chose to use (neural) word embeddings with temporal referencing (<a   id="x1-6"></a>Dubossarsky et al., 2019); I&#8217;ll explain what that means in a bit.

To construct our corpus, I used a Python script to download the pdfs of all articles published in six high-profile (see, <a   id="x1-7"></a>Leiter, 2022), generalist philosophy journals (<em>Australasian Journal of</em> <em>Philosophy</em>; <em>Analysis</em>; <em>Mind</em>; <em>No√ªs</em>; <em>Philosophical Studies</em>; <em>Synthese</em>) between 1971 and 2021. We only included full-length, original articles (so no abstracts, book reviews, errata, etc.). I then removed cover pages, headers and footers, converted the pdfs to plain text and cleaned up the resulting text files. Table <a  href="#x1-8r1">1</a> shows the number of articles from each journal, as well as the total number of articles.
