Hanging around experimental philosophers at times, I've been asked more than once if I knew which journals are happy to publish XPhi. I usually point people to Li and Zhu (2023), who got the meta-data for all articles published between 2001 and 2020 that are categorized as Experimental Philosophy on PhilPapers, and then generated a list of the twenty journals that have published the most these articles (Table 2). It occurs to me, however, that this list could do with an update. Also, Li and Zhu do not report which might interest experimental philosophers looking for a place to publish.

I downloaded the meta-data for all entries PhilPapers categorizes as Experimental Philosophy, restricted the dataset to articles published between 2000 and 2024 (excluding forthcoming), and removed obvious rubbish data (e.g., journal name = 'IsFrontMatter: put either 1 or 0: 1 if this is not an article but a \"front matter\" type of entry, e.g. a list of books received, 0 otherwise'). This left me with 1,901 articles from 449 journals. Below are these journals ranked by the number of XPhi articles they've published (I omit journals that have published fewer than 5 articles):

Unsurprisingly, the top 20 looks very similar to Li and Zhu's list.

There are a number of journals on this list that I don't think many people would think of (primarily) as philosophy journals. Cognition, Cognitive Science, Frontiers in Psychology, Behavioral and Brain Sciences, and Consciousness and Cognition, for example, are all first and foremost psychology (perhaps cognitive science) journals. Yet some experimental philosophers prefer to publish in philosophy journals (for fear of having too many 'strange-looking' journals on their CV, for example). PhilPapers lets users search for articles by journal. To exclude non-philosophy journal, I decided to only keep data from journals that show up on PhilPapers' list of journals. (It's possible to take issue with this definition of what counts as a philosophy journal, of course. For my purposes, I think it's good enough: It excludes many journals that are obviously not philosophy journals, and doesn't exclude any journals that clearly are philosophy journals.) Since I had already downloaded the records for these journals a while ago, this has the added benefit of allowing me to calculate the proportion of XPhi articles in each journal (rather than just raw counts). This is useful because the amount of articles published by different journals between 2000 and 2024 varies dramatically, and so for an experimental philosopher who wants to know where to send their article, the proportion of XPhi articles might actually be the more relevant guide.

A few observations. First, currently, Review of Philosophy and Psychology is the closest thing there is to a dedicated XPhi journal---~16% of the articles published there since the journal's renaming in 2010 have been in experimental philosophy. This is more than twice the proportion of XPhi articles that got published in Philosophical Psychology (#2). So when Li and Zhu (p. 37) write that "Philosophical Psychology is by far the most popular journal among experimental philosophers," this isn't entirely accurate. Second, compared to the ranking based on raw counts, older high-profile generalist journals like Synthese, Philosophical Studies, Analysis, PPR, Erkenntnis and Australasian Journal of Philosophy tended to end up lower down the list, while younger high-profile generalist journals like Ergo and Thought tended to move up. Third, there are not a lot of journals (18 out of many hundreds on PhilPapers) for which XPhi articles make up more than 1% of all published articles. So while XPhi has certainly grown in visibility since the 2000s (see below), it is nonetheless still relatively niche.

To end, I thought it'd be interesting to see how the rate at which XPhi articles get published in different has changes over the years. Figure 1 (below) shows the proportion of XPhi articles in the first 20 journals since 2000.

<br>

One thing that strikes me about Figure 1 is that for a number of these journals, the proportion of XPhi articles seems to have been on the decline for the past 10 years or so. Conversely, there do not seem to be very many journals for which the proportion of XPhi articles is currently on a clear upward trajectory. Figure 2, which shows the journal mean proportion (that is, the mean of journal proportions) of XPhi articles since 2000, confirms this impression: While the proportion of XPhi articles initially rose steeply for the first ten years or so, the trajectory has since flattened and may even be starting to decline.
