title: "Which Journals Publish Experimental Philosophy?"
date: 2024-12-12
---

Hanging around experimental philosophers at times, I've been asked more than once if I knew which journals are happy to publish XPhi. I usually point people to Li and Zhu (2023), who got the meta-data for all articles published between 2001 and 2020 that are categorized as Experimental Philosophy on PhilPapers, and then generated a list of the 20 or so journals that have published the largest numbers of these articles (their Table 2). It occurs to me, however, that this list could do with an update (it's been almost 5 years). Also, I'll report a few factoids which are not in Li and Zhu, but which might nonetheless interest experimental philosophers (looking for a place to publish, or otherwise).

I downloaded the meta-data for [all entries PhilPapers categorizes as Experimental Philosophy](https://philpapers.org/browse/experimental-philosophy) (25 Nov, 2024), restricted the dataset to articles published between 2000 and 2024 (excluding forthcoming), and removed obvious rubbish data (e.g., journal name = 'IsFrontMatter'). This left me with 1,901 articles from 449 journals. Below are these journals ranked by the number of XPhi articles they've published (I omit journals that have published fewer than 5 articles):

Reassuringly, the top 20 is very similar to Li and Zhu's list.

There are a number of journals on this list that I don't think many people would think of (primarily) as philosophy journals. _Cognition_, _Cognitive Science_, _Frontiers in Psychology_, _Behavioral and Brain Sciences_, and _Consciousness and Cognition_, for example, are all first and foremost psychology (or maybe cognitive science) journals. Yet some experimental philosophers prefer to publish in philosophy journals (for fear of having too many 'strange-looking' journals on their CV, for example). PhilPapers lets users search for articles by journal. To exclude non-philosophy journal, I decided to only keep data from journals that show up on [PhilPapers' list of journals](https://philpapers.org/journals). (It's possible to take issue with this definition of what counts as a philosophy journal, of course. For my purposes, I think it's good enough: It excludes many journals that are obviously not philosophy journals, and doesn't exclude any journals that clearly are philosophy journals.) Since I had already gotten the records for these journals a while ago (24-25 July, 2024), this has the added benefit of allowing me to calculate the proportion of XPhi articles in each journal (rather than just the raw count). This is useful because the total number of articles published by different journals between 2000 and 2024 varies dramatically [between 16 (_WIREs Cognitive Science_) and 7,960(!) (_Journal of Business Ethics_)], and so for an experimental philosopher who wants to know where to send their article, the proportion of XPhi articles might actually be the more relevant guide.

A few observations. First, _Review of Philosophy and Psychology_ is the closest thing there is to a dedicated XPhi journal---~16% of the articles published there since the journal's renaming in 2010 have been in experimental philosophy. This is more than twice the proportion of XPhi articles that got published in _Philosophical Psychology_ (the #2). So when Li and Zhu (p. 37) write that "Philosophical Psychology is by far the most popular journal among experimental philosophers," this might not be entirely accurate. Second, compared to the ranking based on raw counts, older [high-profile generalist journals](https://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2022/07/best-general-philosophy-journals-2022.html) like _Synthese_, _Philosophical Studies_, _Analysis_, _PPR_, _Erkenntnis_ and _Australasian Journal of Philosophy_ tended to end up lower down the list, while younger high-profile generalist journals like _Ergo_ and _Thought_ tended to move up. Third, there are not a lot of journals (18 out of many hundreds on PhilPapers) for which XPhi articles make up more than 1% of all published articles. So while XPhi has certainly grown in visibility since the 2000s, it is nonetheless still relatively niche (and might remain so, see Figure 2).

To end, I thought it'd be interesting to see how the rate at which XPhi articles get published has changed over time. Figure 1 (below) shows the trajectory of the proportion of XPhi articles since 2000 for the twenty journals that published the highest overall proportion of XPhi articles during that time.

![Figure 1. Proportion of XPhi articles since 2000 for the top 20 journals by overall proportion.]({{site.url}}/something-of-crunch/assets/images/2024-12-12/figure1.png){: width="85%"}

<br>

One thing that strikes me about Figure 1 is that for a number of these journals, the proportion of XPhi articles seems to have been on the decline for the past 10 years or so. Conversely, there do not seem to be very many journals (among these 20) for which the proportion of XPhi articles is currently on a clear upward trajectory (_AJOB Empirical Bioethics_, maybe _Synthese_, maybe _Inquiry_). Figure 2, which shows the journal mean proportion (that is, the mean of individual journal proportions for each time bin) of XPhi articles since 2000, confirms this impression to some extent: While the mean proportion of XPhi articles rose very steeply for the first ten years or so, it has since plateaued and may even be starting to decline (though more time will need to pass before it is possible to make that determination with any sort of confidence).

<p style="text-align:center; font-size: 0.85em; padding-right: 30px; padding-left: 30px;">Figure 2. Journal mean proportion of XPhi articles since 2000.</p>
<br>

Another thing to note about Figure 1 is that for some journals, their overall relatively high proportion of published XPhi articles is mostly or entirely due to a tall spike during a single three-year period. For example, almost 15% of articles published in _Midwest Studies in Philosophy_ between 2006 and 2008 were in experimental philosophy; for the remaining three-year periods, that proportion is 0%. (As far as I can see, the reason for this is that their [2007 issue](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/toc/14754975/2007/31/1) is on experimental philosophy.) The situation looks to be similar for the _Journal of Cognition and Culture_, _Mind and Language_, _Philosophical Explorations_, and the _Journal of Theoretical and Philosophical Psychology_. These journals, then, may not be the best bet for experimental philosophers looking for a place to publish their work.
